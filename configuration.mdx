      # After clicking verification link in email
      curl -X POST https://api.ahmedrehan.com/auth/verify \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"token":"verification_token_here"}'
      ```
      ```javascript
      // In your application
      const userData = {
        email: 'developer@company.com',
        name: 'John Developer',
        organization: 'Tech Corp'
      };
      
      fetch('/api/users/setup', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify(userData)
      });
      ```
